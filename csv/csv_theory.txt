We will work with pandas library because its powerful for data manipulation and analysis but with csv we can
work with libraries like csv, but we will keep pandas because we will use it for excel the same.

We first import pandas
# import pandas as pd

Reading csv file (df is dataframe, dataframe is an 2 dimensional table , rows and columns)
# df = pd.read_csv("csv_name.csv")

If we have and delimiter like ';' we use
# df = pd.read_csv("csv_name.csv", delimiter=';')

Read first five rows from table
# print(df.head())
